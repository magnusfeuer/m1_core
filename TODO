	Implement a font tool for X11 and rip the "bank gothic"
	font for 20 and 24 points, medium weight.

	     01-06-2007

			Partly implemented by using the edf font
			format for png images.
			Used fstobdf to convert radio space fonts.

	Implement video recording capability, save result on
	a file. VideoRecord Component? Injecting to a screen/layer?
	or as a special screen ?

	 Make type conversion in the linter, off loading the
	 compiler and the eval. Detect and add calls to
	 functions like float2signed, unsigned2float...

28-05-2007
	Replace tokens in expression node with operation codes.
	instead of '-' then use op_SUB for the general case
	and when type checking is done op_SUB is replaced by either
	op_SUBi, op_SUBu, op_SUBf. With + we will have op_ADD then
	op_ADDi, op_ADDu, op_ADDf, op_ADDs.

		Fixed converting all internal operators. After total
		type checking and type conversion is done in linter
		the operators will also be types (i.e op_SUB => op_SUBi etc)

	 Implment array copy.
	 assignment of (fixed) array MUST be done by copy.
	 Today the array is just replaced. Boring side effects.

28-05-2007
	Implement connect expressions. x <- y + 1 as
	suger for
	      type _Tx0 {
		     input event float _in0;   // y
		     output event float _out;

		     script { out = in1 + 1; }
		}
		x <- @_Tx0 { _in0 <- y }._out;

        29-05-2007

		Fixed. Most cases are working. Still some work
		on the type checking for type convertion in the
		output.

	Dynamic m1 loading. Loading of undefined types.
	This could be done by looking in a path for 
	a file called <type>.m1  and later <type>.m1c (or both)
	looking for a type called :UI:Button will load a
	file called UI.m1 (UI.m1c) then try to find Button inside.

28-05-2007
	Compiler work. Should be staight forward after the linter
	has done it's work. We may want to resolve indices at runtime.
	First compiler could work in compile while loading mode.

25-11-2007
	Change builtin function type spec using string type specs,
	instead of simple type tags. Today type tags can not be used
	to specifiy float arrays or string array for example.
	M1TYPE_ARRAY will then be replaced by "s[]" or "f[]"
	

25-11-2007
	Lint Compund statments into stack operators, everythings 
	should be ready in eval to do this transformation.
	Today objects are created in compund this is no longer neccesary
	since we dropped the idea of nested environments.
