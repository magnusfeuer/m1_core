HOWTO 

  The m1 is started trough the m1e (or m1e.debug) executable.
  Currently the m1e takes following options:

	  -L <lib-path>

		Add (append) a library path

	  -F <font-path>
		Add (append) a font path.

	  -d
		Turn on debugging output same as -DI

	  -D[ELPIW]
		A	debug everything
		I	informational output
		M	memory debugging
		L	lint debug
		C	compile debug
		E	eval debug
		P	print terms for both eval and lint
		W	warning output
		T	type checker



  After one or more m1 files may be given.
